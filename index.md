### **Lab 1 parts 1 and 2:**

#### This lab was especially intriguing because of the fact that it was the first lab that exposed me to programming and like anything else, the first is the most memorable, as it opens you up as to what there is to expect going forward. This lab along with the contributions of my partner who also was on the same level in terms of programming experience made for a cornerstone that hopefully creates a strong foundation of the fundamental building blocks of programming. Looking back some of the base level concepts and things that we did are things that I still reference from time to time until I get a better understanding of some things and for that, it was my favorite Lab.

### **Lab 09 Part 1**

#### This lab was particularly interesting for the fact that it used the ifstream functions to be able to take in files as inputs. The reason that I found this lab so interesting was that in all of the labs prior to this we were manually entering inputs via user input, where this lab taught us how to use a file, and input that to be able to execute the program. The usage case for this particular program was very interesting because of the fact that one of the things I had prior to this lab was how to use files in conjunction with programs like how data scientists do and how many programs around us do in one way, shape or form.  

### **Lab 08 Part 1**

#### This lab for me was pretty fun in the fact that is used a lot of what we had used up to this point the majority of things that we had learned about or reference in the lecture such as vectors, static casting, counter controlled for loops etc. and with that in mind it really helped to get a visual grasp of how each function or variable can get nested into one another to create for some really cool and intricate pieces of code.
